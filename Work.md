### Authentication in Appwrite using JavaScript

This code snippet demonstrates authentication functionalities using the Appwrite SDK in a JavaScript environment. Below are detailed notes explaining each aspect of authentication:

```javascript
import { Account , Client, ID } from "appwrite"; // Importing necessary modules from Appwrite SDK
import config from "../config/config"; // Importing configuration file

export class AuthService {
    client = new Client(); // Initializing Appwrite client
    account;

    constructor(){
        // Setting up the Appwrite client with endpoint and project ID from configuration
        this.client.setEndpoint(config.appwriteUrl).setPorject(config.appwriteProjectId);
        this.account = new Account(this.client); // Creating an account instance using the client
    }

    async createAccount({email,password,name}){
        try {
            // Creating a new account with unique ID, email, password, and name
            const userAccount = await this.account.create(ID.unique(),email,password,name);

            if (userAccount) {
                // If account creation is successful, initiate login
                this.login({email,password})
            } else {
                return userAccount; // Return user account details
            }
        } catch (error) {
            throw error; // Throw any errors encountered during account creation
        }
    }

    async login({email,password}){
        try {
            // Authenticating user with email and password to create a session
            return await this.account.createEmailSession(email,password);
        } catch (error) {
            throw error; // Throw any errors encountered during login process
        }
    }

    async getCurrentUser(){
        try {
            // Retrieving details of the current authenticated user
            return await this.account.get();
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("Appwrite service error!! ",error); // Logging service error if any
        }
        return null; // Returning null if unable to retrieve current user details
    }

    async logout(){
        try {
            // Deleting all sessions associated with the current user
            return await this.account.deleteSessions();
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("Appwrite service error :: Logout, ",error); // Logging service error if any during logout
            throw error; // Throwing error if logout operation fails
        }
    }
}

const authService = new AuthService(); // Creating an instance of AuthService

export default authService; // Exporting the AuthService instance
```

### Notes:

1. **Importing Modules**: The code imports necessary modules from the Appwrite SDK (`Account`, `Client`, `ID`) and a configuration file.

2. **Appwrite Client Initialization**: The `AuthService` class initializes an Appwrite client with the provided endpoint and project ID.

3. **Account Instance Creation**: An instance of the `Account` class is created using the initialized client.

4. **Account Creation**: `createAccount` method allows creating a new account by providing email, password, and name. It returns user account details upon success.

5. **Login**: The `login` method authenticates a user with email and password to create a session.

6. **Get Current User**: `getCurrentUser` method retrieves details of the currently authenticated user.

7. **Logout**: `logout` method deletes all sessions associated with the current user, effectively logging them out.

8. **Error Handling**: Errors are caught and handled appropriately using `try...catch` blocks. Any encountered errors are thrown for external handling.

9. **Instance Export**: An instance of `AuthService` is created and exported to be used across the application.

This code provides a structured way to handle authentication operations using the Appwrite SDK in a JavaScript environment.



### Appwrite Databases and Storage Service

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of Appwrite's Databases and Storage services in a JavaScript environment. Below are detailed notes explaining each aspect of the service:

            await this.databases.deleteDocument(
                config.appwriteDatabaseId,
                config.appwriteCollectionId,
                slug
            )

        }
    }

    async getPosts(queries = [Query.equal("status", "active")]){

    }

    // File upload service

    async uploadFile(file){
        try {
            // Uploading a file to the specified storage bucket
            return await this.bucket.createFile(

const service = new Service(); // Creating an instance of the Service

export default service; // Exporting the Service instance
```

### Notes:

2. **Appwrite Client Initialization**: The `Service` class initializes an Appwrite client with the provided endpoint and project ID.

3. **Databases and Storage Instances**: Instances of `Databases` and `Storage` services are created using the initialized client.

4. **Database Operations**:
   - `createPost`: Creates a new document in the specified database collection.
   - `updatePost`: Updates an existing document in the specified database collection.
   - `deletePost`: Deletes a document from the specified database collection.
   - `getPost`: Retrieves a document from the specified database collection.
   - `getPosts`: Lists documents from the specified database collection based on provided queries.

5. **File Upload Operations**:
   - `uploadFile`: Uploads a file to the specified storage bucket.
   - `deleteFile`: Deletes a file from the specified storage bucket.
   - `getFilePreview`: Retrieves the preview URL for a file from the storage bucket.

6. **Error Handling**: Errors are caught and logged appropriately using `try...catch` blocks.

7. **Instance Export**: An instance of `Service` is created and exported to be used across the application.

This code provides a structured way to interact with Appwrite's Databases and Storage services for managing data and files in a JavaScript environment.
